== Apache Software Foundation: The World’s Largest Open Source Foundation

== The ASF’s Mission
[.small]#The Apache Software Foundation (ASF) is a US 501(c)(3) charitable organization.
Its mission is to provide Open Source software for the public good.
We do this by providing services and support for many like-minded software project communities of individuals who choose to join the ASF.#

A **neutral space** where projects which are **independent** from any corporate influence can prosper and create **Open Source software** for the **public good**. Under the business-friendly Apache License 2.0

== Established as a public charity in 1999

[.big]#*Mission: To provide software at no charge for the public good.*#

== ASF provides project governance
[.big]#The Apache Way#

== “The Apache Way” core principles
* Rough consensus and working code
* Small reversible steps
* Any constructive contribution DOES earn merit... while corporate affiliation and seniority DOESN’T
* Merit doesn't expire
* Merit doesn't give you authority; it gives you access
* No BDFLs, no vetoes - relying on building consensus instead

== !
[.big]#**“The Apache Way” +
AKA +
 “Community over code”**#

== Why the ASF Works: The Apache Way
* **Meritocracy** — Individuals earn merit by what they do and how.
* **Transparency** — Our projects are developed in the open, so everyone who wants to participate is able to.
* **Community** — We place community health over all else

[.big]#And yet it is NOT the right fit for every project#

== The Apache Way Ensures:
* Vendor Neutrality
* Diversity
* Trust
* Safety

[.small]#And also a number of Bronze sponsors, full up-to-date list at http://www.apache.org/foundation/thanks.html#

== Why existing projects come to Apache
* **Corporate Citizenship** — Give to charity
* **Higher Quality** — More developers with different perspectives
* **Collaboration vs Competition** — It's easier to work with competitors on open source projects that benefit everyone
* **“Free” Training** — The community can train your new developers easier than you can
* **Legal Protection** — The ASF protects contributors

== The Apache Incubator
[.twocolumns]
--
* The official entry path for projects to enter The Apache Software Foundation.
* Mentorship helps train communities in "The Apache Way".

== Community Building
* **Politeness** — Be nice
* **Respect** — Everyone’s point of view has value
* **Trust** — Assume the best intentions
* **Humility** — Others might have better ideas

[.small]#Code of conduct: https://www.apache.org/foundation/policies/conduct.html#

== Licensing is a key aspect
* **Provenance** — Establish where every line of code originated
* **Trademarks** — Must not conflict with existing names
* **Software Grants** — The owner of the intellectual property of existing code/test/documentation must grant rights to Apache
* **Contributor Licenses** — Contributions while at Apache are governed by contributor licenses:
** Copyright, Patent, Distribution/Modification

== Apache License
* Universal donor
* Pragmatic
* Free for commercial and non-commercial use
* Compatible with other Open Source licenses

== Licensing
* **Category A** - can depend on and include in release
** MIT, 2 and 3 clause BSD
* **Category B** - can depend and may be able to include
** Common Development and Distribution License (CDDL), Eclipse Public License (EPL), Mozilla Public License (MPL), Creative Common Attribution (CC-A)
* **Category X** - can't depend on or include in release
** GPL, LGPL, non commercial licenses, JSON

== Release distributions
* Legally an act of the Foundation
** “Does NOT need to work”
** “Does need proper licensing”
* Authorized by the Project Management Committee
** Vote required
** Digital Signature(s) required
* Distributed via extensive mirror system

== Releases
* Are signed
* Need an incubating disclaimer
* Have LICENSE and NOTICE files
* Follows license terms of ALv2 and any included 3rd party software
* Source files have ASF headers
* Consist of source with no compiled code

== Binary releases
* Are not required
* Are not official releases
* Also need to follow policy


== Graduation
[.twocolumns]

== ServiceComb Incubating Journey

image:ServiceCombIncubating.png[]

== Who is Willem Jiang ?
* Huawei OpenSource Center Technical Expert
* Former RedHat Principal Engineer
* Apache Member
* VP Apache ServiceComb

== ServiceComb Introduction
* **Java Chassis** - High performance Java service engine with MicroServices governance
* **Service Center** - High performance Service Center based on Etcd
* **Pack** - A Centrical distributed transaction coordinator which supports Saga and TCC
* **Mesher** - A services mesh implementation based on Go
* **Kie** - A new designed MicroServices configuration center

== Find a way to Apache
* Writing a proposal of your project
* Finding a Champion and Mentors
* Proposal discussion in IPMC
* Starting a vote of your proposal
* Creating a podling project inside of Apache Incubator
* SGA, CLA, iCLA Signing
* Podling name searching

== Integrating with Apache Infrastructure
* **Mail lists** — “If it isn't on an archived list, it didn't happen”.
* **Issues** - Using JIRA or github issue to track the development related issues.
* **Source repository** — Viewing all parts of the system is open to the public.
* **Build/Test**  — Most projects now incorporate continuous integration build and test processes.
* **Establish a Web Presence** — Each project has its own unique web page https://project.apache.org

== Community
* **Users** — Users are the reason a project exists. No users ⇒ no project
* **Contributors** — Our projects depend on contributions from the community -- bug reports, email discussions, bug fixes, documentation
* **Committers** — Frequent contributors become committers after demonstrating merit
* **Project Management Committee Members** — The PMC is responsible for setting the direction of the project, authorizing releases, and voting new committers and PMC members

== Growing the community
* Raising The Profile
** Improving the website, using grassroots media
** Submitting talks to conference, writing articles
** Working with downstream projects
* Building a community by stepping back a little
* Helping developers become committers

== Voting Rules of Release
* Vote in the open on mailing list, open for 72 hours
* Release needs to comply with ASF policy
* Needs 3 +1 votes and more +1’s than -1’s
** A -1 vote (a veto) doesn't block the release
** -1 needs to have a reason to be valid
** Can change your vote
* If vote passes then the IPMC votes on the release
* If vote fails then create new release candidate and vote again

== Why you might vote -1 in IPMC
* Unexpected compiled code in release
* Includes software with incompatible license
* Issue with LICENSE and NOTICE files
* Issue with copyright
* Missing ASF headers
* Contains encryption software

== Practice makes perfect
* Not expected to get it right first off
* Licensing is complex
* May not be familiar with policy
* Policy is more guidelines, there are few absolute rules
* DISCLAIMER-WIP
* Release early and release often
* Each release better than the last

== Graduation from Apache Incubator
* Complete (and sign off) tasks documented in the status file
* Ensure suitable project name and product names
* Demonstrate ability to creating an Apache Release
* Creating an Open and Diverse community
* Check with apache project maturity model

[.small]#http://community.apache.org/apache-way/apache-project-maturity-model.html#

== Support The ASF
* The ASF is funded through **tax-deductible contributions** from corporations, foundations, and private individuals
* **The ASF spends 10% or less on overhead**
* ASF Infrastructure keeps Apache critical support services running 24x7x365 for **less than US$5K per project/year**
* Help keep Apache software projects **freely available to ALL** around the world
